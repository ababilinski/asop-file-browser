## Connections

Choose **File Transfer Mode** for everyday transfers. Choose **Developer Options** for Phone Tools and Wi-Fi.

| | File Transfer Mode | Developer Options |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Browse, preview, upload, and download | Yes | Yes |
| Wi-Fi | No | Yes |
| Phone tools (Screenshot, Record, Control) | No | Yes |

For File Transfer Mode, unlock the phone, choose **File transfer / Android Auto**, then scan the phone in the Mac app.

For Developer Options, connect with USB debugging or pair over Wi-Fi. Wi-Fi pairing uses the QR code shown on your Mac.

[File Transfer Mode steps](https://ababilinski.github.io/asop-file-browser/connect/#file-transfer) · [Developer Options steps](https://ababilinski.github.io/asop-file-browser/connect/#developer-options)

## Phone Tools

With Developer Options and USB or Wi-Fi debugging, you can:

- Search everywhere instead of just the current folder.
- See a detailed breakdown of your device storage.
- Drag APK, XAPK, APKS, and split ZIP packages from Finder to install them. Dropping several APKs opens an editable install queue in the Progress panel, with per-app errors for downgrade and signature conflicts.
- Remove, open, stop, or clear apps.
- Capture one display or combine multiple displays side by side in one screenshot or recording.
- Open more than one connected device at a time. Each device gets its own screen and control bar.
